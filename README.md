## Key Features:
- **Advanced Server Integration:** Incorporate various tiers of servers in exchange for goods and manage the heat production meticulously.
- **Overheat Management:** Stay vigilant! Overheating leads to automatic server shutdowns, so it's essential to monitor the temperature actively.
- **Customizable Mod Settings:** Optimize your experience with adjustable settings available in the Mod Setting menu.
