## Update April 2024

- Updated to version 1.5
- Customizable resource list available in mod settings
- Fixed heat pusher issue
- Adjusted resource generation

### Details:
1. **Customizable Resource List in Mod Settings:**  
   You can now add any item to your generation list via the mod menu. However, be careful as some items may not function correctly when spawned or are not intended to be spawned this way. Proceed with caution.

2. **Heat Pusher Issue Fixed:**  
   Previously, all Server Racks shared the same heat emission, even when empty. Now, each Rack pushes heat according to its power consumption.

3. **Adjusted Resource Generation:**  
   Generation is now relative to the market value of each item, to account for items significantly more expensive than Spacer Components.

## Generating Mechanism

The servers allow you to generate all the listed resources provided there is sufficient power supply to support the operation. The only limiting factor in the resource generation process is the summed calculating power of the servers in the server rack, meaning more advanced servers will enable quicker and more efficient resource generation. Properly managing the power consumption, calculating power, and heat production of each server is crucial to maximize resource generation efficiency.

## Servers

There are three types of servers available in this mod. You can put up to 12 servers in a single server rack. The power consumption, calculating power, and heat production will sum up in the server rack.

## Server Types & Details

### Basic Server

- **Description:** A basic server useful for typical operations.
- **Cost:** 50 Steel, 3 Industrial Components
- **Power Consumption:** 200 Watts
- **Calculating Power:** 1 THz
- **Research Prerequisites:** ServerBasic

### Advanced Server

- **Description:** An advanced server with higher processing power and storage.
- **Cost:** 70 Steel, 5 Industrial Components, 2 Spacer Components
- **Power Consumption:** 500 Watts
- **Calculating Power:** 3 THz
- **Research Prerequisites:** ServerAdvanced

### Glitterworld Server

- **Description:** A highly advanced server originating from the most technologically advanced worlds. Has unparalleled processing speed and storage.
- **Cost:** 50 Plasteel, 5 Industrial Components, 5 Spacer Components
- **Power Consumption:** 1200 Watts
- **Calculating Power:** 8 THz
- **Research Prerequisites:** ServerGlitterworld

## Heat Production

The heat production of each server is directly related to its power consumption in watts.

## Boosting Research Speed

All operating Server Racks combine their research speed. By positioning one adjacent to a High-Tech Research Bench, it can tap into the collective research speed of all Server Racks.

## Note

To utilize the servers effectively, make sure to properly manage the server rackâ€™s accumulated power consumption, calculating power, and heat production. Enjoy managing your advanced commercial servers!
